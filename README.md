# Tandem Partner

A tandem partner is someone to chat with who understands your own language at least a little bit and the language you want to learn very well. The idea is to encourage usage of the new language through interactivity and the possibility to switch back to your own language to ask questions.

In this case, I want to learn Chinese and my tandem partner will be Lang, an LLM with access to a database of vocabulary I want to learn.

I started this tandem partner chat bot after having participated in the HMS Analytical Software PubQuiz Hackathon that took place on 17. January 2024. [Here](https://github.com/HMS-Analytical-Software/Hackathon-Pubquiz) is the Hackathon respository.
It was a great starting point for getting into the topic. With this project I want to deepen my understanding and hopefully create something useful for myself.
